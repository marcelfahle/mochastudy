This is, or at least, it's going to be an app for 
practicing Livemocha.com flashcards, which has a 
horrible mobile interface. 
This app grabs your saved flashcard sets out of your
livemocha.com account and provides you a nice HTML5
interface, focussed on mobile devices, so that you can 
study on the go.
